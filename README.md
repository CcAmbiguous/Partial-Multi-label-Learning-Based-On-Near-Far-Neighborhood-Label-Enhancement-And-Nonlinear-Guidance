abstract = {Partial multi-label learning (PML) deals with the problem of accurately predicting the correct multi-label class for each instance in multi-label data containing noise. Compared with traditional multi-label learning, partial multi-label learning requires learning and completing multi-label classification tasks in an imperfect environment.The existing PML methods have the following problems: (1) the correlation between samples and labels is not fully utilized; (2) the nonlinear nature of the model is not taken into account. To solve these problems, we propose a new method of PML based on label enhancement of near and far neighbor information and nonlinear guidance(PML-LENFN). Specifically, the original binary label information is reconstructed by using the information of sample near neighbors and far neighbors to eliminate the influence of noise. Then we construct a linear multi-label classifier that can explore label correlation. In order to learn the nonlinear relationship between features and labels, we use nonlinear mapping to constrain this classifier, so as to obtain the prediction results that are more consistent with the realistic label distribution.},
